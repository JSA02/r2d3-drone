# Welcome to the r2d3-drone Repository

This initiative focuses on engineering a novel land-air hybrid drone, optimized for operation in hostile environments and maintenance tasks. The goal of this project is the development of a versatile drone that can navigate challenging terrains and provide robust performance under adverse conditions.

## Open-Source Hardware Designs

Key to our approach is the utilization of open-source methodologies. All hardware designs crafted for this project are freely accessible in the [hardware section](https://github.com/JSA02/r2d3-drone/tree/main/hw). These designs were developed using open-source tools, including FreeCad and OpenSCAD, ensuring wide accessibility and community engagement.

## Project Phases

This project is structured in three phases: 

1. **Component Salvage and Integration:** This phase involves the recovery of functional parts from a decommissioned drone. The objective is to repurpose these components, integrating them with an older drone chassis to achieve operational capability.

2. **Chassis and Propulsion Design:** The second phase is centered on the conceptualization and creation of a drone chassis specifically designed for interior environments. This includes the design of an efficient propeller, culminating in the realization of a fully functional flying prototype.

3. **Protective Mechanism and Mobility Enhancement:** The final phase aims to augment the drone's durability and versatility. This involves the design of a protective exterior shell, akin to a ball, which is connected to the drone via a gimbal. This innovative design allows the drone to roll on the ground, absorb impacts, and navigate through rugged terrain with ease, significantly enhancing its utility in challenging environments.

We invite collaboration and contributions to this pioneering project, as we endeavor to push the boundaries of drone technology and open-source hardware development.
